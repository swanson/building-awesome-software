subject: How Buildings Learn (and why software is no different)
---

Just a quick hitter this week, as I am traveling to Chicago for [SCNA][scna] &mdash; come find me if
you are going to be there!

I like to read material from outside of software; I find thinking about how I can apply some lessons
from other fields to programming to be very stimulating.

Ideally, I like to find stuff that is approachable to a beginner. If a doctor wanted to learn about
how software teams solve problems, we shouldn't recommend [Knuth's TAOCP][k]; they are probably 
better with something like [Joel on Software][j] or [The Mythical Man Month][mm].

I was really pleased to stumble across this [MetaFilter curation][mf] entitled "What single book is 
the best introduction to your field for laypeople?".

One of the fields that piqued my interest was architecture and building construction. From that post, 
I found a book called [How Buildings Learn][hbl]. I knew this would be good just based on the short
summary:

> An illustrated book on the evolution of buildings and how buildings adapt to changing requirements over long periods

Replace buildings with software and you've probably got a best-seller from Pragmatic Programmers!

I was about to pull the trigger on this book when I found that the author (Steward Brand) 
actually produced a BBC mini-series about it. And, because we live in an amazing time, Mr. Brand
has graciously uploaded the whole thing to [YouTube][yt].

And it is really lovely; I watched the whole thing over two evenings. I would highly recommend it 
to anyone that builds software.

*(Warning: there is a very loud and obnoxious beeping during the first 10 seconds or so)*

Let me know if you have come across any other cross-displinary gems or if you want me to share more
of the ones I have found.

And, as always, please reply with any comments, feedback, questions, or requests :)
