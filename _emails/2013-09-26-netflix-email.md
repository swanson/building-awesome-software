Email is a really powerful tool for delighting your users, but I find that
tons of apps are failing to take advantage of it. Sure, you probably don't want
to get cute with your Password Reset instructions, but there are so many missed
opportunities to create a great user experience.

Here is an email I got this week from Netflix.

Subject: Congratulations to House of Cards!

Uh, what? This email does nothing for me (except make me consider hitting
the unsubscribe button). It is like an internal Netflix company e-card
accidentally got sent to all 29 million subscribers. Yikes.

Netflix, you are better than this!

This was a great opportunity for Netflix to earn some brownie points in my
book. Instead of that email, why not something like "Congrats to House of
Cards on three Emmys. To celebrate, we've made the first episode free to stream -
tell your friends!". Cool - now I'll tweet out a link because I freakin' loved that
show and I want all my friends to watch it.

Don't like that version? How about "House of Cards won three Emmys, thanks so much
for your support. We couldn't have done it without great fans like you watching the
show and telling your friends, so here is a free month off your bill". Offer that
to anyone that watched all the episodes of *House of Cards* (you've got that data
Netflix). Boom, instant brand zealots.

Okay, maybe that is too costly. One more idea: since Netflix knows I watched all
of *House of Cards* and that, in the past, I rented all of *The Wire* on DVD and I've
streamed a few seasons of *Mad Men* - they can probably infer that I like critically
acclaimed TV dramas. Why not craft an email like "Congrats to House of Cards on 
three Emmys (though you probably know that since you have great taste in TV shows)!
Thanks to your support, Netflix will continue it's commitment to producing great
original content that we know you'll love." Why yes, I do have great tastes, don't I?

Netflix - you have the data, use it! Make me feel special, give me something, help
me become a [bad-ass user][ks]! Don't treat the emails you send like throwaway 
communications.

There isn't anything really wrong with the original email (aside from being boring
and unnecessary...) but I had such a strong reaction because I know Netflix can do
better. 

And I know that I would want to do better in my own software.
