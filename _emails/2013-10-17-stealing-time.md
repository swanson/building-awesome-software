subject: Stealing time
---

Software moves fast these days; it is a challenge to stay up to date with all
the new technology and frameworks that seem to pop up almost every day. We all
have limited time to explore and learn and it is tough to find a balance with
your work and home life.

I won't pretend to have all the time constraints that some have &mdash; I am a 
single, 25 year old guy &mdash; but there are a few things I do to "steal time"
that are generally applicable.

# Consume more than food during lunch

If you are working a typical office job, you are probably taking 30 minutes to
an hour every day to eat lunch. Twenty-two work days a month &times; 30 minutes
a day = 11 hours of consumption time. It is pretty simple to go heat up some
leftovers, turn on a video, and learn something.

With 11 hours, you could watch two whole seasons of the excellent series
[Destroy All Software][das] or a dozen of the [top conference talks][cf] from 
the past year.

Some people like getting out of the office or taking a mental break over lunch,
which is totally fine. But maybe you can set aside Tuesdays as the day when
you eat a PB&J and watch an [Uncle Bob talk][ub].

If you don't like videos (or it isn't kosher to watch them in your office), you
can do the same thing with blog posts or a software book. It is just a little
harder since you will need to occasionally scroll the screen or turn a page, 
don't spill!

The key here is to have your materials prepared in advance. If you have to spend
10 minutes downloading a screencast or flicking through Hacker News you a) 
won't make effective use of this time and b) won't be eating food. So do a 
little planning and queue up interesting stuff throughout the month as you
come across it.

# Re-capture sunk time

Our time is often allocated to things that we cannot control. It is one thing
to stop watching so much TV, but some activities aren't able to be eliminated.

My biggest two sunk time activities are my daily commute and chores. But I am 
able to double-up and make that time valuable for my own professional 
development.

When driving, I replace crappy radio stations with technical podcasts. It's like
having your own talk radio program that doesn't just yell about politics! My typical
breakdown for podcasts is roughly: 50% programming, 25% productivity/
workplace stuff, and 25% comedy (I need a break every once in a while). I've
written about some of my favorite podcasts ([here][p1], [here][p2], and 
[here][p3]) before if you need some suggestions.

Likewise, you can turn on a podcast while you are doing the laundry, vacuuming,
or cleaning dishes. Basically any low-mental overhead activity is a chance for
you to mix in some technical content.

# Put it on the calendar

I am a huge believer in [gradual progress][gp], so I highly recommend setting 
aside some regular time for working on a side-project. I meet every Monday 
evening for a few hours to work on stuff with a [fun group of people][isl]. You 
could start up a similar group with just 2 people.

Not everyone has the flexibility to miss a potential family meal every
week (and eating at the same restaurant every Monday is kind of gross...) but
use the idea, not my implementation. I know of people that block off time early
in the morning or late at night on the weekends.

Having a consistent time set aside helps me to not get distracted when working
on other things. Because I know I have dedicated time to work on new ideas, I
don't get sucked down a rabbit hole exploring new and shiny things whenever I 
see them.

And if you really need a kick in the ass, go read what 37signals have to say
about [time management][dhh].
