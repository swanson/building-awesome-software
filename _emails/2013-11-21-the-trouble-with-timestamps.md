The pretty "time ago" format has become popular on the web.

And it's good...until it isn't.

There are certain types of data where the pretty format is fine. It originally
came from social networks, where the content was very time-sensitive. When
people talk about something posted on Facebook, they usually say something
like "Did you see that picture Bill put on Facebook the other day?". You
would get funny looks if you said "Did you see that picture posted on 
2013-11-21T01:46:06+00:00?" So the timestamps matched the real-world format.

But what about `git` commits? What if I needed to see exactly when a change was
introduced into my code? The bug report was entered on October 04, have we
fixed it already? We deployed a build on October 01 at 2:30pm, what other
changes also went out?

A month ago doesn't really tell me a whole lot in this case.

(ProTip&trade;: you can hover over dates on GitHub to see the full timestamp)

Think about the context &mdash; most people don't refer to status updates based
on specific times or dates. But I'm sure you'll want to know the
exact date of when your bank sent a bill payment if you are on the phone with a
collection agency.

What are the common use-cases for timestamped data in your app? Do users want
a rough estimate or an exact value? Is the data short-lived or an important
reference point?

The "time ago" style is prettier, but it isn't always the most functional.
